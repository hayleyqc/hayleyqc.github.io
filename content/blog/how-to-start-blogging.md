# How to Start Blogging as a Designer

Welcome to my very first blog post! ðŸŽ‰

As a designer, sharing your thoughts and work online can open new doors, help you reflect on your process, and connect you with a wider community.

## Why Blog?

- **Showcase your portfolio**  
  Blogging lets you go deeper into your projects than a simple portfolio page.

- **Share your process**  
  Write about the steps, challenges, and lessons learned.

- **Connect with others**  
  People love reading about real experiences and stories.

## How to Add Images

You can easily add images to your blog post using Markdown:

```markdown

```
